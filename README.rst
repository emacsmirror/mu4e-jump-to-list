mu4e-jump-to-list.el: mu4e automatic jump-to-list extension
===========================================================

``mu4e-jump-to-list`` allows to select and view mailing lists
automatically using existing ``List-ID`` headers in your mu_ database.

``mu4e-jump-to-list`` is bound to "l" by default in both the mu4e main
and header views and shows active lists in recency order by default,
with lists with new messages first.

``mu4e-jump-to-list`` integrates with mu4e-query-fragments_ when
installed, allowing the use of query fragments in all filter
definitions.

This package is fully documented in the source and maintained through MELPA:
